Hi! I'm Luning Wang (ÁéãÈ∫ìÂÆÅ), currently a first-year master student majored in electronic and computer engineering.

**I‚Äôm now actively looking for (research/engineering) intern opportunities in the field of LLMs, MLSys, and potentially other AI & Data-Science related fields!** See the <a href='#intern'>internship</a> section for details.



üéì Education
------
+ [08/2024~05/2026] M.S. Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Michigan
+ [09/2020~06/2024] B.E. Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University

üìñ Research
------
I mainly focused on the efficient algorithms of large language models in my past research, including the compression and acceleration techniques of LLMs. I‚Äôm currently trying to get on the way of multimodal models and diffusion models. See my publications to learn more about my works.

I'm lucky to have been working with these groups:

+ [09/2022~06/2024] NICS-EFC, Tsinghua Univ. <a href="https://nicsefc.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/">[website]</a>

I‚Äôm open to research cooperation opportunities in the field of LLMs, Multimodal Models, MLSys, and potentially other AI & Data-Science related fields.

<!--üå± More about myself
------
During my leisure time, I love hanging out in the wild and travelling around (in a casual way). I'm really enthusiastic about exploring more places around the United States in the next two years! 

I am a fan of fantasy and epic movies. *Lord of the Rings*, *Harry Potter* and *Pirates of the Caribbean* are some of my favourite masterpieces.

Also, I've been an avid collector of antiques (especially ancient coins ü™ô) for many years. I'm always attracted by things that have a sense of age!-->
