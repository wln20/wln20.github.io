Hi! I'm Luning Wang (ÁéãÈ∫ìÂÆÅ), currently a Master's student at the <a href='https://umich.edu/'>University of Michigan</a>. Before that, I got my Bachelor's degree at <a href='https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/'>Tsinghua University</a>.

**I‚Äôm now actively looking for research/engineering full time work opportunities in the field of LLMs, MLSys, and potentially other AI-related fields. I'm expected to graduate in 05/2026 and planning to work in China Mainland or Hongkong or Singapore.** Feel free to contact with me via <a href='mailto:wangluning2@gmail.com'>Email</a> if there's an opportunity!

<!--üå± More about myself
------
During my leisure time, I love hanging out in the wild and travelling around (in a casual way). I'm really enthusiastic about exploring more places around the United States in the next two years! 

I am a fan of fantasy and epic movies. *Lord of the Rings*, *Harry Potter* and *Pirates of the Caribbean* are some of my favourite masterpieces.

Also, I've been an avid collector of antiques (especially ancient coins ü™ô) for many years. I'm always attracted by things that have a sense of age!-->
